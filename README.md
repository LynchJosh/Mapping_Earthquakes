##	Overview of Earthquake Challenge Folder
The purpose of this project was to take a geo JSON file and plot Earthquake data including the tectonic plates. I used Mapbox to create a map that displayed all the information required. Every circle on the map represent an earthquake that was detected and the color represents what magnitude it was.
